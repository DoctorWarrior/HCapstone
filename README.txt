—Introduction—

Overview of Shuxu’s capstone:

	Inspired by VL2 bilingual story apps that focus on American Sign Language and
English, Shuxu took VL2 stories to her former school in China. The children responded 
enthusiastically to the stories and immediately wanted to share their stories in Chinese 
Sign Language not only with Shuxu but also with the world. In response, Shuxu created
a new application for sharing multi-lingual signed and written stories to a worldwide
audience. VL2 story apps include only ASL and English, and are for purchase; VL2 also
sells the code to develop stories in other languages, but the code requires technical
expertise to use. Shuxu’s new app uses a special set of Java-based tools to allow sharing
stories in any signed language and written forms of spoken languages without cost and
without the need for technical expertise.
	Known as Sign and Share, this new app has been built upon a specific
combination of web development tools known as the MEAN stack: MongoDB;
Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js. Each component of the MEAN stack uses JavaScript,
which means that the web front-end (what the user sees) and the underlying database are
connected by a single programming language. This singularity allows for faster
communication and unified code. Overall, the technical structure of the app consists of a
front-end website and iOS mobile app (built with Angular.js and Bootstrap), a server
(built with Node.js and Express.js) that communicates between the client and the
database, and a back-end database (MongoDB) that stores user information and
comments on the uploaded videos.
	The cutting-edge features of the full-stack app provide a social utility to deaf
users the world over by allowing them to share their video stories, in both signed and
written (spoken) languages, and to view other users’ stories. To date, Shuxu has
completed several functions (sign in accounts; user agreements; video uploads with
description and a capacity for comments and ratings). She has plans to add more
functions for a fully robust and sophisticated website.
